    <p>
      The &lt;p&gt; HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually
      represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent
      blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs
      can be any structural grouping of related content, 
      <!--such as images or formfields.-->
